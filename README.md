## 🌐 Arc Protocol

The **Arc Protocol** (AP) is a unified standard for:

- Syntax Highlighting  
- Language Servers  
- Code Formatting  

### Goal

AP aims to **standardize the developer experience** by sharing syntax, diagnostics, and formatting for each language.  

**Why AP over LSP?**  
While LSP handles code intelligence (completion, hover, diagnostics), AP goes further by including formatting, syntax highlighting, and any other essentials for a polished development workflow.
